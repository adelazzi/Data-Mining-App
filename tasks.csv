Issue,File,Description,Priority,Recommendation
Incomplete Function,/home/adel/Desktop/calcul/Data-mining-S2/visualizations/cluster_plot.py,"The create_diana_plot function is defined but there's no implementation of create_diana_plot in perform_diana_clustering in clustering.py",High,"Complete the implementation for Diana clustering to match with clustering visualization"
Import Error,/home/adel/Desktop/calcul/Data-mining-S2/main.py,"The main.py imports create_diana_plot but visual implementation doesn't appear to be referenced in the perform_diana_clustering function",Medium,"Ensure proper implementation of DIANA clustering or remove the import if not needed"
Missing Function,/home/adel/Desktop/calcul/Data-mining-S2/main.py,"perform_diana_clustering is imported but not completed",High,"Complete the implementation of this functionality or remove if not needed"
Invalid Version,/home/adel/Desktop/calcul/Data-mining-S2/requirements.txt,"Some package versions may not exist (e.g., numpy 2.2.4, matplotlib 3.10.1)",High,"Verify and correct package versions in requirements.txt"
Missing Import,/home/adel/Desktop/calcul/Data-mining-S2/main.py,"tk is used but not imported",Medium,"Add 'import tkinter as tk' at the top of the file"
