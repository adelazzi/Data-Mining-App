# Data Visualization Tool

This project provides powerful **data visualization**, **preprocessing**, and **machine learning** capabilities through an intuitive graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Supports CSV and ARFF file formats.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, normalization, and handling of missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Offers box plots, QQ plots, scatter plots, and more.
- **Classification Models**: Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
- **Regression Models**: Supports Linear Regression and Neural Networks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Enables performance assessment and predictions for your datasets.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----
To start the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the following command to launch the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py


### Example Workflow

1. Launch the application.
2. Load a dataset in CSV or ARFF format.
3. Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values or normalize).
4. Visualize the dataset using the built-in plotting tools.
5. Apply machine learning models for classification or regression.
6. Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions.

Requirements
------------
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. All dependencies required for this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

To install the dependencies, run:
